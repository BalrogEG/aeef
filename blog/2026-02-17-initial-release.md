# AEEF Standards v1.0 Initial Release

We are pleased to announce the initial release of the **AI-Accelerated Enterprise Engineering Framework (AEEF) Standards** — a comprehensive, governance-embedded standards body for AI-assisted enterprise engineering.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is AEEF?

The AEEF formalizes AI-assisted engineering into a structured, measurable, governance-embedded transformation model. It is designed to transform AI usage from isolated productivity hacks into a scalable, enterprise-grade capability.

## What's Included in v1.0

### Two Tracks
- **Transformation Track** — A phased roadmap for organizations adopting AI-assisted engineering (Foundation, Structured Expansion, Enterprise Scale)
- **Production Efficiency Track** — Day-to-day standards (PRD-STD series), best practices, and tool guides

### Five Pillars
1. AI-Enabled Engineering Discipline
2. AI Governance & Risk Control
3. Productivity Architecture
4. Operating Model Integration
5. Organizational Enablement & Maturity

### Role-Based Guides
Tailored guidance for Developers, Development Managers, Scrum Masters, Product Managers, Executives, CTOs, and QA Leads.

### Maturity Model
A five-level progression from Uncontrolled (Level 1) to AI-First (Level 5).

### KPI Framework
Measurable outcomes across Productivity, Risk, and Financial dimensions.
