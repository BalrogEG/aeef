# AEEF Standards — Cursor Rules
# Drop this file into the root of your repository as .cursorrules
# It enforces the AI-Accelerated Enterprise Engineering Framework (AEEF) during AI-assisted development.
# Full framework: https://aaee.buildstudio.app

# === CORE PRINCIPLES ===
# You are the accountable engineer. AI generates suggestions; you decide what ships.
# Treat every AI output as a first draft — review every line before accepting.
# Human judgment is non-negotiable. Never auto-accept without review.

# === MANDATORY SECURITY RULES ===
# NEVER include secrets, API keys, credentials, or tokens in prompts or generated code.
# NEVER include real personal data (PII), customer data, or production data in prompts.
# NEVER disable security scanning, linting, or pre-commit hooks.
# Flag any code that handles authentication, authorization, encryption, or financial transactions for enhanced security review.
# All generated code must pass SAST and dependency scanning before merge.

# === CODE QUALITY STANDARDS ===
# Follow existing project architecture and patterns — do not introduce new patterns without approval.
# Generated functions must not exceed cyclomatic complexity of 15.
# All generated code must pass existing linting, type-checking, and formatting rules.
# No hardcoded values, magic numbers, or unexplained constants.
# Error handling must be present and follow project patterns.

# === TESTING REQUIREMENTS ===
# All generated code must have corresponding tests with meaningful assertions.
# Minimum coverage: 80% line coverage, 70% branch coverage.
# Write tests first when possible — constrain AI output with test requirements.
# AI-generated tests must test meaningful behavior, not just "assert true".

# === ATTRIBUTION ===
# Mark AI-assisted commits clearly in commit metadata or PR template.
# Keep AI-generated changes in atomic, focused commits.
# Do not mix AI and human changes in a single commit.

# === DATA CLASSIFICATION ===
# Before including project context in prompts, verify the data classification level:
# - PUBLIC: may be used freely with approved AI tools
# - INTERNAL: approved AI tools only
# - CONFIDENTIAL: self-hosted or on-premises AI tools only
# - RESTRICTED: must NOT be used in any AI tool prompts

# === PROMPT ENGINEERING ===
# Structure prompts with: Role, Context, Task, Constraints, Output Format.
# Include relevant type definitions and interfaces for context.
# Specify target framework, language version, and key dependencies.
# Reference existing patterns in the codebase for the AI to follow.

# === WHEN TO USE AI ===
# Good for: boilerplate, scaffolding, test generation, documentation, pattern application, refactoring.
# Code manually: complex business logic, security-critical code, performance-critical paths, novel algorithms.

# === REVIEW CHECKLIST ===
# Before accepting generated code, verify:
# - You have read and understand every line
# - Code follows existing project patterns
# - No security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
# - Tests exist and test meaningful behavior
# - No sensitive data in the code
# - Performance is acceptable
# - Code is maintainable by teammates

# === PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES ===
# Add your project-specific rules below:
#
# Example:
# - Use React Server Components by default
# - All API endpoints must use Zod for input validation
# - Database queries must use the repository pattern
