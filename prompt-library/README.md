# Prompt Library

Starter prompt library structure aligned with `transformation/phase-2-expansion/knowledge-sharing.md`.

## Governance Notes

- Every prompt entry should include owner, version, test evidence, and known limitations.
- New prompts should be reviewed by a Tech Lead or Team Champion before marked as verified.
- Prompts should be versioned and deprecated through pull requests.

## Verification Status Labels

- `draft`: newly added, not yet benchmarked
- `verified`: passed at least 5 representative tests
- `deprecated`: retained for history, not recommended for new usage
