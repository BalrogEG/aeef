# Vulnerability Response SLAs

## Severity SLAs

| Severity | SLA | Default Action |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 24 hours | Block release and hotfix |
| High | 7 days | Prioritized sprint remediation |
| Medium | 30 days | Planned remediation |
| Low | 90 days | Backlog with owner |

## Response Workflow

1. Validate finding and affected assets.
2. Classify severity and assign engineering owner.
3. Apply containment if exploit risk is immediate.
4. Patch, test, and verify in CI.
5. Capture root cause and update guardrails/prompt templates.

## Required Evidence

- Scan report reference
- PR or patch reference
- Verification test evidence
- Closure approval by security owner
