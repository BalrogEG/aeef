# Scrum Master Guide

AI-assisted development changes the dynamics of every agile ceremony and process you facilitate. Velocity becomes more variable, estimation models need recalibration, and new impediment categories emerge that traditional agile coaching does not address. This guide equips you with the knowledge and techniques to facilitate AI-augmented development teams effectively while preserving the agile principles that make teams healthy and productive. It implements [Pillar 4: Continuous Improvement](/pillars/pillar-4-operating-model/) and supports [Pillar 5: Organizational Alignment](/pillars/pillar-5-organizational-enablement/).

## How AI Changes Your Role

Your core responsibility has not changed -- you still serve the team by removing impediments, facilitating processes, and protecting the team's ability to deliver value. But the specific challenges you face are different.

| Traditional Challenge | AI-Augmented Challenge |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Team struggles with estimation accuracy | Estimation variance increases because AI acceleration is unpredictable per task |
| Velocity is relatively stable sprint to sprint | Velocity fluctuates as AI effectiveness varies by story type |
| Impediments are primarily organizational or technical | New impediment categories: tool access, AI quality concerns, skill gaps, prompt effectiveness |
| Team health concerns: burnout, conflict, unclear requirements | New health concerns: AI anxiety, skill relevance fear, cognitive load from reviewing AI output |
| Sprint planning is capacity-based | Capacity planning must account for AI learning time and review overhead |

## What This Guide Covers

| Section | Focus Area | Key Outcome |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| [Sprint Adaptation](/roles/scrum-master/sprint-adaptation) | Planning, execution, and review process changes | Adapted sprint processes that account for AI dynamics |
| [Estimation in an AI World](/roles/scrum-master/estimation-ai-world) | New estimation techniques and uncertainty management | More accurate sprint planning despite variable AI acceleration |
| [Ceremony Adjustments](/roles/scrum-master/ceremony-adjustments) | Standup, planning, demo, and retro modifications | Ceremonies that surface AI-specific insights and issues |
| [Impediment Patterns](/roles/scrum-master/impediment-patterns) | Common AI-related impediments and resolution strategies | Faster impediment identification and resolution |
| [Team Health Indicators](/roles/scrum-master/team-health-indicators) | Confidence, satisfaction, cognitive load, and collaboration metrics | Early detection of team health issues related to AI adoption |

## Prerequisites

To apply this guide effectively, you should:

- Have experience facilitating agile teams (at least 6 months as a scrum master or agile coach)
- Understand the basics of AI-assisted development (read the [Developer Guide overview](/roles/developer/) for technical context)
- Have access to the team metrics described in [Metrics That Matter](/roles/development-manager/metrics-that-matter)
- Coordinate with your [Development Manager](/roles/development-manager/) on team enablement status (see [Team Enablement](/roles/development-manager/team-enablement))

## Key Relationships

| Role | Your Interaction | Shared Concern |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Developer](/roles/developer/) | Facilitate their process, remove impediments, protect their focus | Sprint processes work for AI-augmented workflows |
| [Development Manager](/roles/development-manager/) | Co-own process design, share team health data | Team enablement, quality metrics, performance context |
| [Product Manager](/roles/product-manager/) | Manage expectations, negotiate scope, facilitate trade-offs | Velocity variability, quality vs. speed trade-offs, story sizing |
| [QA Lead](/roles/qa-lead/) | Integrate quality checkpoints into sprint flow | Testing strategy alignment, defect trend awareness |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Protect learning time.** During the first 2-3 months of AI adoption, teams need dedicated time to learn new tools and workflows. Protect this time from sprint pressure, even if it reduces short-term velocity. See [Team Enablement](/roles/development-manager/team-enablement).

2. **Normalize variability.** AI-assisted development introduces more variance into delivery timelines. Help stakeholders understand that higher average throughput with higher variance is the expected pattern, not a problem to solve.

3. **Surface quality signals early.** Use your ceremonies to make quality metrics visible. The [Quality & Risk Oversight](/roles/development-manager/quality-risk-oversight) framework provides the indicators; your ceremonies provide the forum for discussion.

4. **Facilitate, do not prescribe.** Teams will find different optimal workflows with AI tools. Your role is to facilitate experimentation and learning, not to prescribe a specific AI usage pattern. Let the [Developer Guide](/roles/developer/) provide technical guidance while you focus on process.

5. **Watch the humans, not the tools.** The most important things to observe are team dynamics, confidence levels, and collaboration patterns -- not tool usage statistics.

## Getting Started

Follow this sequence for your first month facilitating an AI-augmented team:

1. **Week 1:** Read [Sprint Adaptation](/roles/scrum-master/sprint-adaptation) and adjust your next sprint planning session
2. **Week 1:** Implement the [Team Health Indicators](/roles/scrum-master/team-health-indicators) pulse survey
3. **Week 2:** Introduce the [Estimation in an AI World](/roles/scrum-master/estimation-ai-world) techniques at your next planning session
4. **Week 2:** Review the [Impediment Patterns](/roles/scrum-master/impediment-patterns) catalog and prepare resolution strategies
5. **Week 3-4:** Apply the [Ceremony Adjustments](/roles/scrum-master/ceremony-adjustments) to all your agile ceremonies
6. **End of Month 1:** Conduct a focused retrospective on AI adoption using the techniques in this guide

This guide assumes your team is using Scrum. If you practice Kanban or another agile method, the principles apply but the ceremony-specific advice will need adaptation. The underlying patterns -- estimation uncertainty, new impediment types, and team health dynamics -- are universal.
