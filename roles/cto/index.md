# CTO / VP Engineering Guide

As the senior technical leader in your organization, you are responsible for defining the technology strategy, architecture standards, and organizational design that determine whether AI-assisted engineering succeeds or fails at scale. While developers interact with AI tools daily and managers oversee team-level quality, you must address the systemic questions: Which tools to bet on, how to evolve your architecture for an AI-augmented world, when to build versus buy, how to structure teams, and how to manage the technical risks that emerge from this fundamental shift in how software is created.

## Your Strategic Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Pre-AI Focus | AI-Augmented Focus |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Technology strategy** | Language, framework, and platform selection | AI tool ecosystem strategy, model evaluation, multi-tool architecture |
| **Architecture** | System design, scalability, maintainability | AI code quality patterns, maintainability at higher volume, consistency governance |
| **Build vs. buy** | Custom software vs. commercial products | AI tool evaluation, custom prompt libraries, platform decisions |
| **Organizational design** | Team topology, reporting structures | New roles (AI Champions, prompt engineers), cross-functional models |
| **Technical risk** | Reliability, scalability, security | AI dependency risks, model reliability, vendor lock-in, accelerated technical debt |

## What This Guide Covers

| Section | Strategic Question It Addresses |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| [Technology Strategy](/roles/cto/technology-strategy) | How do we evaluate, select, and manage AI development tools? |
| [Architecture Considerations](/roles/cto/architecture-considerations) | How does AI-generated code affect our system architecture and code quality? |
| [Build vs. Buy](/roles/cto/build-vs-buy) | Should we build custom AI tools, buy commercial products, or combine both? |
| [Organizational Design](/roles/cto/org-design) | How should we structure teams and roles for AI-augmented development? |
| [Technical Risk Management](/roles/cto/technical-risk) | What technical risks does AI introduce and how do we manage them? |

## Key Decisions Ahead

As CTO, you will face these decisions in the coming months. Each section of this guide prepares you for one or more of them.

1. **Tool portfolio selection.** Which AI tools to adopt as organizational standards, and how many to support simultaneously. See [Technology Strategy](/roles/cto/technology-strategy).
2. **Architecture governance update.** How to evolve your architecture standards and code quality requirements for AI-generated code. See [Architecture Considerations](/roles/cto/architecture-considerations).
3. **Build-or-buy for AI tooling.** Whether to invest in custom AI tools, prompt libraries, or platforms. See [Build vs. Buy](/roles/cto/build-vs-buy).
4. **Organizational restructuring.** Whether to create new roles, change team topologies, or establish centers of excellence. See [Organizational Design](/roles/cto/org-design).
5. **Risk governance framework.** How to establish and maintain governance that manages AI-specific technical risks. See [Technical Risk Management](/roles/cto/technical-risk).

## Relationship to Other Roles

| Role | Your Interaction | What They Need From You |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [Executive / CEO](/roles/executive/) | Strategic alignment, investment justification, risk reporting | Clear ROI narrative, risk mitigation evidence, competitive positioning |
| [Development Manager](/roles/development-manager/) | Policy setting, tool decisions, quality standards | Approved tools list, architecture guidance, governance framework |
| [Developer](/roles/developer/) | Standards, tooling, career path definition | Access to tools, clear quality standards, skill development investment |
| [Scrum Master](/roles/scrum-master/) | Process guidance, impediment escalation | Tool reliability information, capacity planning guidance |
| [Product Manager](/roles/product-manager/) | Feasibility assessment, velocity context | Honest assessment of AI-driven acceleration and its limits |
| [QA Lead](/roles/qa-lead/) | Quality strategy, testing infrastructure | Security scanning tools, quality gate requirements, testing standards |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Tools are the beginning, not the end.** Tool procurement is the easy part. The hard part is governance, architecture adaptation, skill development, and cultural change. Budget and plan accordingly.

2. **Govern at the right level.** Set organization-wide standards ([PRD-STD-001](/production/standards/PRD-STD-001-prompt-engineering) through [PRD-STD-007](/production/standards/PRD-STD-007-quality-gates)) but allow team-level flexibility in how those standards are met.

3. **Measure what matters.** Demand metrics that reflect real value creation and risk management, not vanity metrics. See [Metrics That Matter](/roles/development-manager/metrics-that-matter).

4. **Plan for change.** The AI tool landscape is evolving rapidly. Design your architecture, processes, and vendor relationships to accommodate change, not resist it.

5. **Invest in humans.** AI tools are only as effective as the humans using them. The highest-ROI investment is in developer skill development and team enablement. See [Team Enablement](/roles/development-manager/team-enablement).

## Getting Started

| Priority | Action | Section |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Define your AI tool strategy and approve initial tools | [Technology Strategy](/roles/cto/technology-strategy) |
| 2 | Update architecture standards for AI-generated code | [Architecture Considerations](/roles/cto/architecture-considerations) |
| 3 | Assess technical risks and establish monitoring | [Technical Risk Management](/roles/cto/technical-risk) |
| 4 | Evaluate build-vs-buy for custom AI capabilities | [Build vs. Buy](/roles/cto/build-vs-buy) |
| 5 | Design the organizational structure for AI-augmented teams | [Organizational Design](/roles/cto/org-design) |
