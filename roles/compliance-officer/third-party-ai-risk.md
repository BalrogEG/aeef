# Third-Party AI Risk Governance

## Vendor Risk Checklist

- Data residency and retention guarantees
- Contractual restrictions on model training with customer data
- SOC 2 / ISO alignment and security attestations
- Incident notification and support SLAs
- Sub-processor transparency

## Approval Flow

1. Security and privacy review
2. Legal and procurement review
3. Pilot with restricted scope
4. Production approval with quarterly revalidation

## Continuous Monitoring

- Track vendor policy changes and incident disclosures.
- Reassess critical vendors quarterly.
- Suspend integrations when high-risk changes are unmitigated.
