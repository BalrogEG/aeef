# PRD-STD-005: Documentation Requirements

**Standard ID:** PRD-STD-005
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active
**Compliance Level:** Level 3 (Optimized)
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-15
**Last Reviewed:** 2026-01-15

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines documentation requirements for AI-assisted development. As AI-generated code proliferates across codebases, organizations face a growing risk of knowledge erosion--the gradual loss of understanding about why code exists, how it works, and what constraints shaped its design. When code is generated by AI, the reasoning behind implementation choices often lives only in the prompt session and is lost when the session ends.

This standard ensures that AI-assisted development produces adequate documentation to preserve institutional knowledge, enable effective maintenance, and support future development by engineers who were not involved in the original generation.

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:

- All production code generated, modified, or substantially influenced by AI coding assistants
- Architecture and design decisions informed by AI-generated proposals
- Prompt engineering artifacts used to generate production code
- Knowledge artifacts created to support long-term maintenance of AI-generated codebases

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **AI-Generated Section** | A contiguous block of code that was substantially generated by an AI coding assistant |
| **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** | A document that captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences |
| **Prompt Documentation** | Records of the prompts, constraints, and context used to generate production code |
| **Knowledge Artifact** | Any document, comment, diagram, or record that preserves understanding of code purpose and behavior |
| **Inline Documentation** | Comments and documentation strings embedded directly in source code |

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Code Comments for AI-Generated Sections

:::danger MANDATORY
**REQ-005-01:** AI-generated code sections MUST include an annotation indicating AI involvement. The annotation MUST include: (a) the AI tool used, (b) the date of generation, and (c) the name of the engineer who reviewed and approved the code.

Example:
```
// AI-Generated: GitHub Copilot | 2025-06-15 | Reviewed by: J. Smith
// Purpose: Rate limiter middleware with sliding window algorithm
```

**REQ-005-02:** AI-generated functions and classes MUST include documentation comments (docstrings, JSDoc, Javadoc, or language-equivalent) that describe:
- The purpose and behavior of the function/class
- Parameter descriptions and types
- Return value description
- Exceptions or errors that may be thrown
- Any non-obvious constraints or assumptions

**REQ-005-03:** AI-generated code that implements business logic MUST include inline comments explaining the business rules, not just the implementation mechanics. Comments MUST answer "why" rather than "what."
:::

:::warning RECOMMENDED
**REQ-005-04:** Organizations SHOULD establish a standard annotation format for AI-generated code and enforce it through linting rules.

**REQ-005-05:** Comments SHOULD reference the original requirements, user stories, or specifications that prompted the code generation.

**REQ-005-06:** Complex AI-generated algorithms SHOULD include a brief explanation of the algorithmic approach and its time/space complexity.
:::

### 4.2 Architecture Decision Records

:::danger MANDATORY
**REQ-005-07:** When AI-generated proposals influence architecture decisions (e.g., technology selection, design patterns, system decomposition), an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) MUST be created that documents:
- The decision context and problem statement
- The options considered (including AI-proposed options)
- The selected option and rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Which aspects were AI-generated versus human-determined

**REQ-005-08:** ADRs MUST be stored in the project repository alongside the code they describe (e.g., `docs/adr/` directory) and version-controlled.
:::

:::warning RECOMMENDED
**REQ-005-09:** ADRs SHOULD follow a standardized template such as the Michael Nygard format or MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records).

**REQ-005-10:** ADRs SHOULD be reviewed and approved by at least one architect or senior engineer.
:::

### 4.3 Prompt Documentation

:::danger MANDATORY
**REQ-005-11:** For production-critical code generation tasks (as defined by the organization's risk classification), the prompts used MUST be preserved as project artifacts. This includes: the full prompt text, relevant context provided, constraints specified, and the AI tool version used.

**REQ-005-12:** Prompt documentation MUST NOT include any sensitive data (credentials, PII, proprietary business data) even if the original prompt contained such data. Sensitive data MUST be redacted before documentation.
:::

:::warning RECOMMENDED
**REQ-005-13:** Organizations SHOULD maintain a prompt log that tracks which prompts were used for which code sections, enabling traceability from requirements to prompts to generated code.

**REQ-005-14:** Prompts that produce high-quality outputs SHOULD be contributed to the organization's prompt library per [PRD-STD-001](/production/standards/PRD-STD-001-prompt-engineering/).

**REQ-005-15:** Teams SHOULD document failed prompt approaches alongside successful ones to build institutional knowledge about effective prompting strategies.
:::

### 4.4 Knowledge Preservation

:::danger MANDATORY
**REQ-005-16:** Projects with more than 30% AI-generated code (by volume) MUST maintain a knowledge preservation document that describes:
- Which components are AI-generated
- Key design decisions and their rationale
- Known limitations or technical debt in AI-generated sections
- Maintenance guidance specific to the AI-generated components

**REQ-005-17:** Knowledge preservation documents MUST be updated when significant changes are made to AI-generated components.
:::

:::warning RECOMMENDED
**REQ-005-18:** Teams SHOULD conduct periodic "knowledge audits" (at least semi-annually) to verify that documentation remains accurate and sufficient for a new team member to understand the AI-generated sections.

**REQ-005-19:** Teams SHOULD maintain architecture diagrams (e.g., C4 model) for systems with significant AI-generated components, showing the boundaries between AI-generated and human-written code.

**REQ-005-20:** Code walkthroughs or recorded explanations SHOULD be created for complex AI-generated subsystems to supplement written documentation.
:::

## 5. Implementation Guidance

### AI Annotation Standards by Language

| Language | Annotation Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Python | Module/function docstring + comment | `# AI-Generated: Claude Code \| 2025-06-15 \| Reviewed: J. Smith` |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | JSDoc + comment | `/** @ai-generated Claude Code 2025-06-15 @reviewer J. Smith */` |
| Java/Kotlin | Javadoc + annotation | `@AIGenerated(tool="Copilot", date="2025-06-15", reviewer="J. Smith")` |
| Go | Comment block | `// ai:generated copilot 2025-06-15 reviewed:jsmith` |
| C#/.NET | XML doc + attribute | `[AIGenerated("Copilot", "2025-06-15", Reviewer = "J. Smith")]` |

```

### Documentation Quality Checklist

For each AI-generated component, verify:

- [ ] AI involvement is annotated in the code
- [ ] All public functions/classes have documentation comments
- [ ] Business logic has "why" comments, not just "what" comments
- [ ] Architecture decisions are captured in ADRs
- [ ] Critical prompts are preserved as project artifacts
- [ ] Knowledge preservation document is up to date (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed as part of the code review process

## 6. Exceptions & Waiver Process

Exceptions MAY be granted for:

- **AI annotation requirements** (REQ-005-01) for trivial code changes (less than 5 lines) where AI assistance was minimal -- the code review record serves as sufficient documentation
- **Prompt documentation** (REQ-005-11) for code generated through IDE inline completions (autocomplete), as individual prompts are impractical to capture
- **Knowledge preservation documents** (REQ-005-16) for projects below the 30% AI-generated code threshold

Waivers MUST be approved by the engineering lead and documented in the project's documentation strategy.
